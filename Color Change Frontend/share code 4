  'Sudden streaks of light, blazing across the strip—each meteor unique in color, length, and speed.',
  'Random meteors shoot fast, unpredictable, each one a different flash. Brightness controls whether it’s a soft glow or a blinding streak.',
  'The LEDs become a night sky—meteors appear when they feel like it, some short, some long, all racing across with their own random colors and speeds. You never know which one will hit next.',
  'Fast, fleeting, random flashes—blink and a meteor is gone.',
  'Like a digital night sky in motion—chaotic, vibrant, and alive.',
  'Every meteor is its own story: color, speed, length all randomized. Tweak the brightness to make them whisper past or scream across the strip.',
  'Unpredictable streaks of light, zipping across at random intervals—keeping the whole effect tense, alive, and hypnotic.'
