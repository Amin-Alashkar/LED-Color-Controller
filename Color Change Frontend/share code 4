  'Colors racing down the strip—fast, random, alive.',
  'Tiny sparks keep running, one after another, colors changing as they fall—like light chasing itself. Brightness? You’re in charge.',
  'It feels like streaks of energy are being released from hidden points, racing endlessly toward the bottom. Each spark dies only to be reborn in a new shade, creating an endless cycle of movement. With brightness control, you choose if it’s a quiet run or a blinding chase.',
  'Flashes on the run—never stopping, never the same color twice.',
  'Random bursts of light keep dropping in sequence, like rain made of neon sparks, looping forever.',
  'The strip becomes a track for colors—each light sprinting downward, resetting, and starting over. It’s chaotic but rhythmic, infinite but always new. Dial the brightness, and the race feels either calm or explosive.',
  'Running sparks—falling, resetting, glowing again. It never really stops, just keeps moving in its own strange rhythm.'
