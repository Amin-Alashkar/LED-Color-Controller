  'Random meteors, now in your color—zap across the strip at insane speeds, each streak unique, brightness under your control.',
  'You pick the hue, the meteor decides the chaos—fast, bright, and fleeting. Colors chase, vanish, repeat.',
  'A cosmic storm, but you hold the palette. Meteors shoot in random timing, length, and speed, leaving a trail that’s all yours.',
  'Speedy streaks explode in your chosen color, unpredictable yet under your command.',
  'It’s your color, your chaos—meteors appear when they want, fly fast, fade fast, and keep the strip alive.',
  'Blink, and you’ll miss it. Each meteor bursts in the color you picked, racing across the LEDs in random flashes.'
