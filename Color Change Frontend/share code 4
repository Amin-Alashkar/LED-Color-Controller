  'Your color, but unpredictable—LEDs glitch on and off like they’ve got a mind of their own.',
  'No pause, no repeat, just chaotic flashes of your chosen hue, like the strip is alive and rebellious.',
  'Random pops of your color—blink and it’s gone, only to reappear somewhere else, always moving, never static.',
  'Feels like digital static in your hue, LEDs jumping on and off in a glitchy rhythm you control.',
  'Endless flashes, no loop to catch—your color explodes in bursts, then vanishes before you even blink.',
  'Like the strip is trolling your eyes—your chosen shade flickers unpredictably, chaos in control.'
