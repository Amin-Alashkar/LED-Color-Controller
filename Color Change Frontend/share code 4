  'Blink in your style—your color dances across the strip in unpredictable bursts, brightness in your hands.',
  'LEDs obey your color command, flashing in short bursts, long pulses, or anything in between.',
  'This isn’t random anymore—it’s your custom blink, each spark chosen by you, every flash a signature.',
  'Short, long, medium—your color sets the pace. Quick bursts or slow blinks, the strip listens.',
  'Blinking isn’t just a pattern—it’s your vibe. You pick the hue, the LEDs do the magic, fading in and out as you like.'
