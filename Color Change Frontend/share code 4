  'A serpent runs right to left, then another returns—endless back-and-forth.',
  'Light travels across the strip like a pulse: one snake slides to the end, then a new one rises from the other side in a fresh random shade. Brightness control makes it either smooth or intense.',
  'It’s symmetry in motion—snakes of color taking turns crossing the strip, first one direction, then the other. Each carries a random hue, disappearing as soon as it arrives. The pattern loops like a heartbeat, but you decide if it glows soft like breath or burns sharp like lightning with brightness control.',
  'One path forward, another back—an infinite chase between colors.',
  'Every run feels like a reply: a serpent crosses, then another answers from the opposite side in its own tone.',
  'The strip becomes a corridor of movement—light snakes sliding right, then left, endlessly. The flow is balanced, yet unpredictable in color. Lower brightness for subtle dialogue, raise it to watch the strip scream with energy.',
  'A constant rhythm of departure and return—color snakes moving in opposite directions, never the same shade twice.'
