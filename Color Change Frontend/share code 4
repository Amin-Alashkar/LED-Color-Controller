Welcome to our Smart Light Controller, the easiest way to customize your lights and create the perfect atmosphere — all from your device. This app is built on FastAPI, which makes it fast, responsive, and reliable, so every action you take is reflected almost instantly on your lights.

✨ What you can do:
	•	Choose colors freely: Pick from a full spectrum of colors to match your mood or event.
	•	Try dynamic animations: From smooth breathing to fast-moving waves, fireworks, and other cool effects. Each animation can be stopped, started, or changed anytime.
	•	Adjust brightness: Make the lights subtle for relaxing nights or bright for parties.
	•	Real-time control: Changes happen instantly as long as your device is on the same Wi-Fi network as the lights. No delay, no lag.

⚡ Important things to know:
	•	The app works only on the same local network. Devices outside your Wi-Fi won’t be able to control the lights.
	•	Some light effects may look slightly different depending on your chosen brightness and color combinations.
	•	The lights stay on the last selected animation until you change them. You don’t need to keep the app open all the time.
	•	Privacy and safety: No internet is required. All communication happens locally on your network, so your data stays private.

💡 Tips for best experience:
	•	Experiment with combinations of colors and animations — you’ll discover new looks you didn’t expect.
	•	Adjust brightness according to the room size and environment to get the most dramatic effects.
	•	Try using multiple devices on the same network — you and your friends can control the lights together in real time.

This app makes controlling your lights fun, creative, and safe. Whether you want a relaxing evening, a small gathering, or a full party vibe, everything is in your hands. Just connect, explore, and enjoy.
