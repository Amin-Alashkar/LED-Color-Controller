  'Snakes of light racing after each other, never stopping.',
  'Each LED forms a serpent—random colors sliding forward, one chasing the next. Adjust the brightness to decide if they slither smooth or strike sharp.',
  'It’s a hunt made of color—multiple snakes twisting through the strip, every body a random shade, every chase endless. They don’t move in chaos but in pursuit, like coded signals of light chasing their own reflections. You choose if the scene glows faint like whispers or burns hot like fire with brightness control.',
  'Fast trails of color that look alive, like light has found its own prey.',
  'Think of it as neon serpents, each with its own shade, weaving across the strip in an endless pursuit.',
  'The effect isn’t static—it’s alive, serpents of color looping through the LEDs, chasing endlessly but never catching. Lower the brightness for subtle motion, raise it and the chase becomes electric.',
  'Lines of light slither forward, random in color but unified in motion, like snakes racing into the dark.'
