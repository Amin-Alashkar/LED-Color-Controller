My Project: Smart LED Control via Local Network

I created a smart and interactive project that connects both programming and hardware. It’s a full web-based system that lets anyone on the same Wi-Fi network control an LED strip connected to my device.

💡 What does it do?

The website I built lets users open a page and fully control the LED strip. It includes:
	•	🎨 A color picker to choose any custom color.
	•	🟦🟥🟩 Pre-set color buttons for quick access.
	•	🌈 Ready-made animations like rainbow effects, waves, or strobes.
	•	🔧 Custom animations where the user selects their own colors and the lights animate between them.

All of this works from any phone or computer browser on the same network — no app needed!

👨‍🏫 How did I do it?

To be honest, this project was not easy — especially since I’m just 16 years old and still learning.
But I had the passion to figure things out by myself.

And guess what?
My teacher let me borrow equipment and a laptop from the school, even though it’s not normally allowed.
Not because he’s a “nice guy” — but because he trusted me, saw I’m responsible, and believed in my potential.

He even gave me some books to study programming on my own.
When he saw the finished project working, he was surprised and told me:

“I can’t believe you built something like this all by yourself at 16!”

⸻

So yeah, this project wasn’t just about lights —
It was about learning, earning trust, and proving what I can do when someone believes in me.

You can try the system yourself and change the LED lights from your own device if you’re on the same network!
