  'A rocket of light, gone in a flash, exploding where you least expect.',
  'Colors launch fast, racing up the strip before bursting into random sparks. Brightness decides if it’s a quiet pop or a blinding explosion.',
  'It feels like celebration coded into LEDs—single rockets darting forward, each in its own shade, before erupting in bursts of light at random spots. Every explosion is different, unpredictable, alive. With brightness under your hand, it shifts from subtle shimmer to firework chaos.',
  'One second it’s a streak, the next it’s gone—only sparks left behind.',
  'Think of it as neon fireworks—fast, random, always surprising.',
  'The strip becomes a sky for digital rockets—colors shooting, exploding, fading away. Dial down the brightness for gentle sparks, or push it up and flood the strip with wild energy.',
  'Unpredictable bursts of color, each one short-lived but impossible to ignore.'
