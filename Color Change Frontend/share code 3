pip uninstall scipy
pip install scipy

pip show scipy

The error occurs because:

"The response module (likely a local file) tries to import tukey from scipy.signal
This import fails due to version incompatibility or missing dependencies
Since you're not actually using response in your main application, removing it is the safest fix"
