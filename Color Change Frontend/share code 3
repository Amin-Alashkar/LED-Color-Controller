Listen… here’s the plan: at the very bottom of the card in your index.html, you’ll add a big wide golden button that instantly grabs attention. That button is basically the key to unlock the admin system.

When the user clicks it:
	•	A smooth, animated login form (username + password) should slide in—nothing clunky or boring.
	•	The user enters their credentials.

If they fail 3 times in a row:
	•	They get locked out with a message like: “Next attempt available in 60 seconds.”
	•	If they fail another 3 times after that, the timeout keeps doubling (120s, 240s, etc.).

If they succeed:
	•	The login form should fade away with a clean animation.
	•	All the buttons on the page switch to a shiny golden theme.
	•	At the very top of the card, a glowing message pops up: “Welcome Admin”.

Right underneath that:
	•	You show a section labeled “Control Buttons” ( button-title in html).
	•	Below it, you display 4 buttons:
	•	Three placeholders (no function for now).
	•	One logout button.

When the user clicks logout:
	•	Everything resets to the original state—no gold, no admin controls, just the normal view again.

⚡ Important: all of this stays within just four files:
	1.	s.css → styling (gold theme, animations, button design).
	2.	index.html → markup (login button, login form, control section).
	3.	admin_system.js → frontend logic (login attempts, timer lockouts, switching colors, showing/hiding controls).
	4.	admin_system.py → backend API that checks the username/password against the database (SQLite), making the whole system real and secure.

⸻

In short: you’re building a mini admin login system, sleek and animated, fully tied into a database-powered backend, and completely hidden unless the right credentials are entered.
