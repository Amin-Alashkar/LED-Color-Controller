I’m running into three main issues:
	1.	Whenever the server retains a color and I update the strip, the UI forcibly resets to black whenever it doesn’t detect a “new” color. As a result, you get a black flash even though the LEDs are still lit in another color.
	2.	The same thing happens with the SSE updates: each incoming message—even if the color hasn’t changed—causes the interface to redraw as if there’s “no color,” so you see unwanted black flickers.
	3.	After logging in as admin, the admin buttons appear briefly but then disappear again whenever a state update (via fetch or SSE) redraws the UI without respecting the logged-in status.
