I want to create a button that looks golden on the outside, but it’s not actually gold—its real color is silver underneath. The gold is just a shiny coating. When I hover over the button with my mouse, I want that gold layer to start peeling away slowly, like little flakes of gold drifting off into the air. As the gold comes off, I want the true silver color beneath it to show through, piece by piece—not all at once. It should feel like the button is being naturally scratched or worn away, revealing the silver base in a random, smooth pattern. I don’t want the silver to pop out instantly—I want it to feel like the gold is breaking off in tiny spots. As I move the mouse over it, I imagine little golden particles flying upward like dust, making it feel alive and fancy. I want the whole thing to have that elegant, premium vibe—like it’s not just a color change, but a reveal of something real and hidden underneath.
